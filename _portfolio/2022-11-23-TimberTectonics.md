**Description:**
<br/>
This pavilion is the result of a research project exploring new building techniques through computational design and robotic fabrication. 
It represents a re-use exploration of Multi-Axis Timber Tectonics, a system originally fabricated for a different government site in the City of Toronto.
Timber Tectonics demonstrates how the principle of reciprocity can be applied to create a reciprocal frame structure, in which short timber members are 
interlocked to span large distances while maintaining structural stability. In this system, elements mutually support one another, forming an efficient 
and resilient structural network. At a time when the construction industry faces material shortages and increasing demands for efficiency, reciprocal frame (RF) 
structures offer a way to do more with less. RF structures can reduce material use, improve fabrication precision, and enable faster assembly, leading to 
lower construction and labor costs. This installation is the first robotically fabricated, doubly curved reciprocal frame structure in the Americas, and 
one of only a few realized worldwide. The project aims to raise awareness of this structural approach and encourage architects, engineers, and builders 
to further explore its potential.

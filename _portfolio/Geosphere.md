**Description:**
<br/>The Geosphere looks at the history and geometry of the geodesic Cinesphere for inspiration. As the Cinesphere remains closed for the duration of the Ontario Place redevelopment plan, we want to create a new sphere using the latest in digital technology to fabricate and populate new hexagonal and polygonal patterns, which were previously too difficult to realize without the proper technology. On the exterior, visitors can see how the form factors generated are dependent on the connections between each of the reciprocal frame members. A reciprocal frame is a grid of linear members where each member simultaneously supports and is supported by its neighboring members. Therefore, the members are structurally interdependent and in a structural hierarchy of equal importance. Collectively, these members have the capacity to cover extensive distances, as demonstrated in this project.
Through an opening in the sphere, visitors can experience an illuminating light experience in the evening. Red fluorescent UV reactive paint is applied to all reciprocal frame members, while blue paint is applied to their connectors.  The combination of these colors not only provides a captivating visual experience, but also explains how the structure is composed. This project aims to be fun, educational, and demonstrate how technology can connect people to a more sustainable future by doing more with less.

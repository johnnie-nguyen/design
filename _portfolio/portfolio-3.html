The surge in mass timber buildings being constructed introduces unique acoustical challenges as mass timber is more permissible for sound to travel across floors, ceilings, and walls, 
especially for lower frequencies. In order to address these acoustical challenges, the absorption qualities of Helmholtz resonators and surface diffusion of scattering surfaces are leveraged 
by combining the two systems in an integrated structure using the tectonics of mass timber construction. This paper investigates the potential of Helmholtz resonators to be used in combination 
with sound scattering surfaces to achieve optimal performance in cross laminated timber (CLT) panels through the use of a hexagonal pattern as the underlying design strategy.

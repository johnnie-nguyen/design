**Description:**
<br/>Obscura is an interactive installation that investigates the perceptual relationship between light, darkness, 
and spatial cognition. Human visual perception relies heavily on illumination to interpret depth and three-dimensional 
form. In conditions of darkness, the eye’s ability to accurately resolve spatial relationships is significantly diminished. 
This work deliberately engages this perceptual limitation. The installation is to be experienced at nighttime. When viewed 
frontally, a carefully composed arrangement of linear and planar elements produces a perspectival alignment that generates 
the illusion of depth. This apparent three-dimensionality emerges not from volumetric form, but from the viewer’s visual system 
actively reconstructing space where none physically exists. Through this controlled manipulation of light, shadow, and alignment, 
Obscura foregrounds the role of the human visual sensory system in fabricating spatial experience under conditions of limited 
information. Under daylight conditions, the luminous effect of the installation is less pronounced. Nevertheless, the perspectival 
illusion remains legible, while the material and structural qualities of the work become more prominent. In this state, the 
installation shifts emphasis from perceptual ambiguity toward formal clarity, allowing the geometry, construction, and spatial 
composition of Obscura to be more fully appreciated.

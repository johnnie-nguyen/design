**Description:**
<br/>
This project investigates how wind, gravity, and material elasticity co-produce dynamic spatial experiences in suspended lightweight canopy systems. 
Using gold foil membranes informed by catenary geometries, the installation explores how base equilibrium forms shift under changing environmental 
conditions, especially with regards to airflow. The structure responds not only to force, but also to the presence of bodies and atmospheric cues, 
creating an architecture in constant negotiation with its context. Through simulation, physical prototyping, and real-time observation, the work 
examines how form emerges from the tension between gravitational logic and aeroelastic response. By bridging design computation, structural performance, 
and material properties, the project reframes temporary ornamentation as an aesthetic and function. What begins as a static drape becomes a performative 
veil that transforms and shimmers with the environment. This study contributes to broader conversations on temporary architecture and the choreographies 
of airflow.

**Description:**The Generative Pavilion project investigated the potential of computational shape optimization and genetic algorithms to enhance traditional timber construction through modular building systems. The goal was to explore new challenges in material tolerances, structural connections, and portability. Utilizing existing node-based methods, the team developed a system featuring Markforge 3D-printed pucks that serve as anchors and orientation markers for 3-axis CNC-milled planar plywood panels. These pucks were subjected to numerous shape optimization studies using the Generative Design Beta feature of the Fusion 360 platform, driving the conceptual exploration beyond conventional material boundaries.

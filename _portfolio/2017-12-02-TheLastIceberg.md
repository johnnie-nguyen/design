**Description:**
<br/>
The Last Iceberg is an architectural installation that spatializes the relationship between human presence and the ongoing degradation of 
global ice sheets caused by climate change. The project foregrounds participation as a primary design mechanism, transforming visitors from 
observers into active agents within the environment. The interior surfaces are finished with thermochromic paint that registers temperature 
change, appearing red under cold conditions and changing color in response to heat generated by touch, breath, and solar radiation. A roof 
aperture at the apex of the structure admits daylight, inscribing the sun’s daily trajectory onto the interior surfaces through gradual 
chromatic transformation. Through this process, human presence becomes legible as a series of transient yet accumulative traces, rendering 
the effects of individual and collective actions materially and spatially visible.

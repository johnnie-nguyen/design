**Description:**
<br/>
Cavalcade is an installation that reflects the collective spirit of human movement and transversal. Not just in the contemporary political 
sense of global migration, but in the consensus that the human quest for a better life is one that is timeless and universal. Cavalcade depicts 
people migrating towards something better. The visistors become a part of this migration as they are led through a maze of silhouettes and meander 
towards the center. There within the midst of this movement,m the visitor will see their reflection off a mirror at the centre of the installation 
that reaffirms this collective connection. After the visistors have left the installation, the footsteps they have left in the snow contributes to the
narrative of people leaving traces of themselves behind.

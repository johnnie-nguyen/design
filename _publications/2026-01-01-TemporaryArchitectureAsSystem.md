**Description:**
<br/>
Temporary architectural structures are typically designed as single-use artifacts, prioritizing speed of construction and formal experimentation over long-term material impact. 
Temporary Architecture as System reframes reciprocal frame structures as reusable architectural assemblies whose environmental performance emerges across multiple cycles of deployment. 
Building on prior research in robotically fabricated, doubly curved reciprocal frames, the paper applies Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to evaluate the embodied environmental impacts of 
repeated assembly, disassembly, transport, and reconfiguration. By comparing reusable reciprocal frame systems to conventional single-use temporary structures, the study demonstrates 
how design decisions related to member geometry, connection strategies, and fabrication workflows influence lifecycle performance over time. The research positions temporary architecture 
not as an expendable object, but as a systemic material strategy capable of supporting circular construction practices through re-use.

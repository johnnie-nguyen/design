**Description:**
<br/>This paper provides a state-of-the-art of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in the building industry. Two methods were used to find this new knowledge: a series of interviews with leading architecture, engineering, and software professionals; and a series of tests in which CFD software was evaluated using comparable criteria. The paper reports findings in technology, workflows, projects, current unmet needs, and future directions.

**Description:**
<br/>
This research investigates how architectural form, specifically roof geometry and building height, has an impact on air flow patterns and pollutant dispersion 
within urban street canyons. Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), the study moves beyond abstract environmental metrics to directly link design decisions 
at the roofline to measurable air-quality outcomes at pedestrian level. The study compares flat and slanted roof configurations across multiple height ratios, 
revealing that roof form significantly alters internal vortex structures within street canyons. Slanted roofs were shown to lift primary vortices upward, 
promoting improved vertical exchange and reducing pollutant accumulation near street level. In contrast, flat roofs tended to trap pollutants within stable 
recirculation zones, exacerbating local air-quality conditions. For architects and urban designers, this work highlights the roofline as an active environmental 
interface, not merely a formal or regulatory constraint. Small geometric modifications can meaningfully influence ventilation efficiency, pollutant residence 
time, and pedestrian exposure. The research positions CFD not as an afterthought for consulting engineers to check, but as an informed analytical tool capable 
of guiding early-stage massing, section, and envelope designs.

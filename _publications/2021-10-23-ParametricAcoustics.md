**Description**
<br/>Architectural design is done entirely in computer-aided design (CAD) systems, and most CAD models are also done in 3D. Beyond CAD, parametric design software is now both popular and accessible to architectural students and practitioners. The most popular parametric system, Grasshopper (GH), is customizable and supports a rich ecosystem of plugins including many types of building performance simulation, including acoustic simulation. Architects often ignore sound and part of the reason for this is a complete lack of sound in architectural design software. Parametric modelling presents an opportunity to integrate sound into architectural design, and at earlier design stages. This opportunity addresses challenges of interoperability and file exchange as modelling and simulation happen within one system. In this paper, we review recent research utilizing parametric modelling combined with acoustic simulation and identify a way of working we call “parametric acoustics”. We further identify nine techniques that can leverage capabilities of parametric modelling and integrated acoustic simulation.

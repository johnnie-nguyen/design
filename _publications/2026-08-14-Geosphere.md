**Description:**
<br/>
Temporary architectural structures are often conceived as single-use artifacts, designed for short-term deployment with limited consideration for reuse or long-term material impact. The Geosphere challenges this paradigm by rethinking of reciprocal frame (RF) systems as reusable architectural assemblies rather than disposable pavilions. Building on prior work in doubly curved, robotically fabricated reciprocal frames, this project examines how structural logic, member sizing, and connection strategies can enable repeated cycles of assembly, disassembly, transport, and reconfiguration. Rather than treating reuse as an afterthought, the research positions reusability as a primary design driver and proposes RF structures as adaptable systems capable of extending material lifespans across multiple deployments.

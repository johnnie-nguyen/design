**Description:**
<br/>Helmholtz resonators, a longstanding concept in architectural acoustics, exhibit excellent acoustic absorption properties but are infrequently utilized in modern architectural practice. Despite resonant absorbers' limited frequency absorption range, their efficacy can be fine-tuned by adjusting resonator geometry. This study posits that advancements in digital design tools, computational building performance simulation, and fabrication techniques facilitate the exploration, testing, and production of novel resonator geometries. We suggest that employing multiple tuned resonators could yield a broadband Helmholtz resonator. Through digitally modeling nine Helmholtz resonator geometries in CAD software and parametrically defining them using parameters like neck width, length, and volume, this study evaluates their performance. These geometries, tested in a virtual impedance tube using COMSOL FEM simulation software, demonstrate the potential for broadband acoustic absorption, particularly with frequency intervals not exceeding 50Hz, and achievable absorption coefficients nearing 1.0 for tunable frequencies.

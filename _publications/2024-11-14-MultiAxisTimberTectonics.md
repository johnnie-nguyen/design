**Description:**
<br/>Over the past few years, sustainable building materials have gained in popularity as environmental
costs associated with concrete and steel construction projects have become increasingly apparent,
a fact that is reflected in the Paris Climate Agreement, which aims to achieve a carbon-free
environment by 2050. Achieving this objective is only possible by actively using building
materials with a low amount of embodied carbon. As forests store a significant amount of the
planet's carbon, using carbon sequestering materials such as wood is an attractive alternative
option. Nevertheless, the ongoing supply chain crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has
negatively impacted all sectors of the forest products industry. A persistent and escalating issue of
inefficiency exists in the wood supply chain, which negatively affects logging operations that
supply wood to mills as well as production delays and interruptions in delivery of goods to
customers. Consequently, wood products have experienced dramatic price increases as a result of
these inefficiencies. It is evident that advanced reciprocal frame structures can assist in an industry
where there is a need to accomplish more with less resources. Material consumption can be
reduced, accuracy can be increased, and cost-effective solutions can be provided by these
structures. This paper investigates the potential of utilizing robotically fabricated, doubly curved,
reciprocal frame structures as an alternative solution to the problems of global climate concerns
and supply chain issues.

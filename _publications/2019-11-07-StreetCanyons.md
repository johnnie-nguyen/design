**Description:**
<br/>
In this study, a three-dimensional numerical simulation of the wind flow and pollutant transport in street canyons is carried out by a new specific solver, which is developed 
and coupled into an open source CFD tool box, the OpenFOAM package. The new model has been applied to study the effect of roof shapes and building heights on the flow patterns 
and pollutant transports in the street canyons. The numerical results have been validated against laboratory experiments. The comparisons between the simulations and observations 
show a good agreement on the flow patterns and pollutant transports.

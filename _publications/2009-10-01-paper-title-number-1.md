In this study, utilizing the open source CFD package OpenFOAM, a series of numerical simulations were conducted employing both Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) methodologies.
The numerical investigation has been implemented for various step angles (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, and 90 degrees), different expansion ratios (1.48, 2.00 and 3.27), and Reynolds numbers (5000, 8000, 11000, 15000, 47000 and 64000). The comparisons of the flow structures, separation flows and re-attachment lengths between the numerical results and observations show very good agreement. The results obtained from LES show greater agreement with observations than the results obtained from RANS model.
